# Data Class

These are classes that have fields, getting and setting methods for the fields, and nothing else. Such classes are dumb data holders and are often being manipulated in far too much detail by other classes. In some stages, these classes may have public fields. If so, you should immediately apply Encapsulate Record before anyone notices. Use Remove Setting Method on any field that should not be changed.

Look for where these getting and setting methods are used by other classes. Try to use Move Function to move behavior into the data class. If you canâ€™t move a whole function, use Extract Function to create a function that can be moved.

Data classes are often a sign of behavior in the wrong place, which means you can make big progress by moving it from the client into the data class itself. But there are exceptions, and one of the best exceptions is a record that's being used as a result record from a distinct function invocation. A good example of this is the intermediate data structure after you've applied Split Phase. A key characteristic of such a result record is that it's immutable (at least in practice). Immutable fields don't need to be encapsulated and information derived from immutable data can be represented as fields rather than getting methods.
