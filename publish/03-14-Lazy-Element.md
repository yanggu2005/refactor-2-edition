# Lazy Element

We like using program elements to add structureâ€”providing opportunities for variation, reuse, or just having more helpful names. But sometimes the structure isn't needed. It may be a function that's named the same as its body code reads, or a class that is essentially one simple function. Sometimes, this reflects a function that was expected to grow and be popular later, but never realized its dreams. Sometimes, it's a class that used to pay its way, but has been downsized with refactoring. Either way, such program elements need to die with dignity. Usually this means using Inline Function or Inline Class. With inheritance, you can use Collapse Hierarchy.
