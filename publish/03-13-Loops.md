# Loops

Loops have been a core part of programming since the earliest languages. But we feel they are no more relevant today than bell-bottoms and flock wallpaper. We disdained them at the time of the first editionâ€”but Java, like most other languages at the time, didn't provide a better alternative. These days, however, first-class functions are widely supported, so we can use Replace Loop with Pipeline to retire those anachronisms. We find that pipeline operations, such as filter and map, help us quickly see the elements that are included in the processing and what is done with them.
