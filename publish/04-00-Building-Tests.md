# Chapter 4: Building Tests

Refactoring is a valuable tool, but it can't come alone. To do refactoring properly, I need a solid suite of tests to spot my inevitable mistakes. Even with automated refactoring tools, many of my refactorings will still need checking via a test suite.

I don't find this to be a disadvantage. Even without refactoring, writing good tests increases my effectiveness as a programmer. This was a surprise for me and is counterintuitive for most programmersâ€”so it's worth explaining why.
