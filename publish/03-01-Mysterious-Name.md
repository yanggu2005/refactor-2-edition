# Mysterious Name

Puzzling over some text to understand what's going on is a great thing if you're reading a detective novel, but not when you're reading code. We may fantasize about being International Men of Mystery, but our code needs to be mundane and clear. One of the most important parts of clear code is good names, so we put a lot of thought into naming functions, modules, variables, classes, so they clearly communicate what they do and how to use them.

Sadly, however, naming is one of the two hard things in programming. So, perhaps the most common refactorings we do are the renames: Change Function Declaration (to rename a function), Rename Variable, and Rename Field. People are often afraid to rename things, thinking it's not worth the trouble, but a good name can save hours of puzzled incomprehension in the future.

Renaming is not just an exercise in changing names. When you can't think of a good name for something, it's often a sign of a deeper design malaise. Puzzling over a tricky name has often led us to significant simplifications to our code.
