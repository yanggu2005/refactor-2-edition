# Going Further

It seems a little strange to be talking about further reading in only the second chapter, but this is as good a spot as any to point out there is more material out there on refactoring that goes beyond the basics in this book.

This book has taught refactoring to many people, but I have focused more on a refactoring reference than on taking readers through the learning process. If you are looking for such a book, I suggest Bill Wake's Refactoring Workbook that contains many exercises to practice refactoring.

Many of those who pioneered refactoring were also active in the software patterns community. Josh Kerievsky tied these two worlds closely together with Refactoring to Patterns, which looks at the most valuable patterns from the hugely influential “Gang of Four” book and shows how to use refactoring to evolve towards them.

This book concentrates on refactoring in general-purpose programming, but refactoring also applies in specialized areas. Two that have got useful attention are Refactoring Databases (by Scott Ambler and Pramod Sadalage) and Refactoring HTML (by Elliotte Rusty Harold).

Although it doesn't have refactoring in the title, also worth including is Michael Feathers's Working Effectively with Legacy Code, which is primarily a book about how to think about refactoring an older codebase with poor test coverage.

Although this book (and its predecessor) are intended for programmers with any language, there is a place for language-specific refactoring books. Two of my former colleagues, Jay Fields and Shane Harvey, did this for the Ruby programming language.

For more up-to-date material, look up the web representation of this book, as well as the main refactoring web site: refactoring.com.
